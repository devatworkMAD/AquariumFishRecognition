Teleostei (teleosts) > Cichliformes (Cichlids, convict blennies) > Cichlidae (Cichlids) > Cichlasomatinae Etymology: Pterophyllum: Greek, pteron, = fin, sail + Greek, phyllon = leaf; apparently in reference to the tall wide and triangular dorsal fin (Ref. 45335). Issue   Redescription based on Peruvian material in Kullander (1986: 210), with bibliography, diagnosis, description, distribution, and illustrations.  Authorship follows Paepke and Schindler (2002). Freshwater;  benthopelagic; pH range: 6.0 - 8.0; dH range: 5 - 13. Tropical; 24°C - 30°C (Ref. 40602); 6°N -   10°S, 78°W -   51°W South America:  Amazon River basin, in Peru, Colombia, and Brazil, along the Ucayali, Solimões and Amazon rivers; rivers of Amapá (Brazil), Rio Oyapock in French Guiana; Essequibo River in Guyana. Maturity: Lm ?  range ? - ? cm Max length : 10.5 cm TL male/unsexed; (Ref. 125882); max. published weight: 25.00 g (Ref. 121647) Body compressed and disc-shaped; dorsal and anal spiny rays increasing in length from anterior to posterior part of the fin; first branched rays also very long; body height at anal fin level 1.07 to 1.29 times in SL; body color silvery with dark vertical bars (7 in juveniles, 4 in adults) (Ref. 35237). Inhabit swamps or flooded grounds where the aquatic and riverine vegetation are dense and the water is either clear or silty.  Its color is deeper in clear water (Ref. 35237).  One of the most popular of all the tropical aquarium fish.  Maximum length 15 cm TL (Ref. 7020).  Aquarium keeping:  in groups of 5 or more individuals; keep pairs in small tanks for breeding; minimum aquarium size 100 cm (Ref. 51539). Males court females during the breeding season. Both male and female guard the eggs which are attached to the surface of aquatic vegetation in a nest area (Ref. 46591). During the entire brooding cycle, bonding of the original pair of parents is maintained complete with defence of each partner against aggression or potential rivals (Ref. 46591).
