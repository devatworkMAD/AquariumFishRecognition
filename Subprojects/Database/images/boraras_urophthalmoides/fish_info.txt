First dorsal-fin ray darkened; dark spot at caudal-fin base and anal-fin base; prominent lateral stripe that fades on peduncle (Ref. 12693). Lives in peats and bog wetlands (Ref. 57235).  Occurs in marshes, swamps and ponds with dense growth of fine-leaved aquatic macrophytes.  Does not seem to require large open areas.  Probably browses on zooplankton in the vegetation.  Never seen in markets, but known from the aquarium trade (Ref. 12693).  Uncommonly seen in aquarium trades but widely used as aquarium bait in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam (Ref. 57235).
