Etymology: Crossocheilus: Greek krossoi = tassel + Greek, cheilos = lip (Ref. 45335).More on author: Fowler. Reticulate pattern of blackish scale margins on the body and a large, black blotch at caudal-fin base (Ref. 27732).  Gill rakers 5-6+28-30 (Ref. 12693). Usually found in clear, relatively fast waters with gravel and boulder (Ref. 27732).  Occurs in medium to large-sized rivers (Ref. 12975).  Moves out onto the floodplain during high water where it feeds on algae, periphyton, phytoplankton and some zooplankton.  Used to make prahoc in Tonlé Sap, Cambodia.  Occasionally imported in the aquarium trade. (Ref. 12693). Rainboth, W.J., 1996. Fishes of the Cambodian Mekong. FAO species identification field guide for fishery purposes.  FAO, Rome, 265 p.
